      Benjamin dillion is a very playful kid even though his ideas lead to trouble somewhere down the line. despite bieng 13 years old he still acts like a child except
      for his knowledge and height the description of him would probably make people think he was a child. Knowing that his dad would need his stuff in the morning he
      decided to find his badge he would need and his drivers license and put it all in one spot so he is able to get it when he needs it but ben did not know that his
      dad already put his badge in a safe place where it would not be bothered and ben just moved it out of its hiding spot. He is helpful but only when he takes matters
      seriously instead of saying i am going to do this but i want to have fun as well. Ben is very idiotic and will never progress if he does not change his attitude to
      match the task he will eventually face.
